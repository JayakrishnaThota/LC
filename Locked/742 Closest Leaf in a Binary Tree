/* Given a binary tree where every node has a unique value, and a target key k, find the closest leaf node to target k in the tree.

A node is called a leaf if it has no children.

In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row by row. The actual root tree given will be a TreeNode object.

Example 1:

Input:
root = [1, 3, 2], k = 1
Diagram of binary tree:
          1
         / \
        3   2

Output: 2 (or 3)

Explanation: Either 2 or 3 is the closest leaf node to 1.
Example 2:

Input:
root = [1], k = 1
Output: 1

Explanation: The closest leaf node is the root node itself.
Example 3:

Input:
root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2
Diagram of binary tree:
             1
            / \
           2   3
          /
         4
        /
       5
      /
     6

Output: 3
Explanation: The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is closest to the node with value 2.
Note:

root represents a binary tree with at least 1 node and at most 1000 nodes.
Every node has a unique node.val in range [1, 1000].
There exists some node in the given binary tree for which node.val == k.
